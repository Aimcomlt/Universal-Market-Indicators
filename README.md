 I might up date eth_History.json but just to make sure get the present market data with the link below..
 You can get all the data from poloniex:

Example: https://poloniex.com/public?command=returnChartData&currencyPair=BTC_ETH&start=1435699200&end=9999999999&period=14400

Chapter one of the A.I. Analytic solution in javascript.
Four part videos:
Part 1 -->(Sorry got to Re-make video) https:/ /youtu.be/pK2yPJMcWwA
part 2 --> https://youtu.be/Ecn3QPf5oLQ
Part 3 --> https://youtu.be/1Rr8J3wCn3g
Part 4 --> https://youtu.be/T5ZbhnLTCuY

You can look at the Poloniex API to figure out how to change the parameters: https://poloniex.com/support/api/

EDIT: Obviously, poloniex will only have information for coins that are available in its exchange. If you want a coin that is not in poloniex, look at some of the other exchanges. I know bittrex also has an API
